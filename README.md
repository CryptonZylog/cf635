CrystalFontz 635 Custom API library
===================================

Back in 2009 I purchased a [CFA635 LCD module](https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfa635tfeku-character-display-20x4-usb-lcd) to play around
with and integrate into the 5.25" drive bay in my computer for drawing metrics like CPU Load / Memory / Drive space / Network activity (4 LEDs)

This was a quick API written to achieve this task. I don't recall there being a C# API that time, so a lot of examples here are taken from
the official datasheet as well as some help from the CrystalFontz Forum.

The development halted around that time and I never got around to finish it.

Today, the LCD module lives in a 1U pfsense box controlled via LCDproc
